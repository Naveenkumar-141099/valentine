            Though we are not next to each other during our first valentines day, we are always bound together with an unknown force or bond whatever it is. For the past 10 months, i have been a joyful soul because of you. Thanks for not giving up on me. I want us to be happy and enjoy our every moments as we do always. I will be the same guy who tries to impress you everytime. You will always be my Precious❤️
